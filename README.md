# CD/DVD Product Management System

This is a simple Java application I have created, for managing inventory of CD and DVD products. With this application, users can easily view, add, deduct, and discontinue products from their inventory.

## Features
* View inventory: Users can view the current inventory of CD/DVD products, including the product name, ID, price, and quantity.
* Add stock: Users can add new products to the inventory, including the product name, ID, price, and quantity.
* Deduct stock: Users can deduct products from the inventory when they are sold, reducing the quantity in stock.
* Discontinue product: Users can mark a product as discontinued, removing it from the inventory and preventing any further stock updates.
* Exit: Users can exit the application when they are finished.
